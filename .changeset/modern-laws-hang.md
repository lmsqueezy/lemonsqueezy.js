- **Deprecate old SDK classes and methods**: The deprecated methods and the LemonSqueezy class will be removed with the next major release.

- **Unit tests**: Introduces comprehensive unit tests for all functions.

## How to upgrade

Use the new setup function to initialize the SDK with your API key.

```

Import functions from the SDK and use them in your application.

```tsx
const { data, error, statusCode } = await getAuthenticatedUser();
```
