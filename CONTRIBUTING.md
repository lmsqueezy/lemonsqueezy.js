## Tooling and Technologies

We utilize a variety of tools to ensure code quality, consistency, and smooth development processes.

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**: for managing the repo and testing.

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: for code formatting. Our codebase adheres to the configuration specified in `prettier.config.js`.

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: for code linting. Make sure to check and fix any linting issues before submitting your code. Our codebase linting rules are defined in `.eslintrc.cjs`.

- **[husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)**: for Git hooks. It ensures that linters, and other checks are passed before commits and pushes.

## Commit Convention

Our project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.

When preparing your commits for a Pull Request, ensure they adhere to our commit message format: `type(scope): description`.

### Types of Commits

Your commits should fall into one of the following categories:

- `feat` (or `feature`): Introduces new code or functionality to the project.

- `fix`: Addresses and resolves a bug. Linking to an issue if available is highly encouraged.

- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, but improve the existing codebase.

- `docs`: Updates or additions to documentation, such as README files, usage guides, etc.

- `build`: Changes affecting the build system, including dependency updates and additions.

- `test`: Modifications involving tests, including adding new tests or refining existing ones.

- `ci`: Adjustments to our continuous integration setup, like GitHub Actions or other CI tools.

- `chore`: General maintenance and organizational tasks that don't fit other categories.

For example, a commit message might look like: `feat: add activateLicense function`.

bun test test/<test-file>.ts
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Branch Workflow

- Develop in dedicated branches, not directly on the `main` branch.

- Use descriptive names for your branches. Make sure the branch name adheres to the format `[type/scope]`, like `feat/button-enhancement` or `docs/update-readme`.

### Adding New Features

- Provide tests for new features.

- Discuss new features in an issue or discussion topic before coding.

### Fixing Bugs

- Describe the bug in detail in your PR.

- Include steps to reproduce or a live demo if possible.

- Link the issue your PR fixes, using the format `fix #issue_number`.

Remember, clear and detailed PRs help us efficiently review and integrate your contributions!

## Creating a Pull Request (PR)

1. **Fork and Clone**: Begin by forking the main repository and cloning your fork.

2. **Branching**: Create a new branch off `main` using the format `[type/scope]`, like `feat/button-enhancement` or `docs/update-readme`. The `type` should align with conventional commit types.

3. **Development**: Make your changes and commit them adhering to the [commit guidelines](#commit-convention). Use `bun run typecheck` to test your changes.

4. **Document Changes**: Run `bun changeset` for a detailed change description. For minor updates (like CI changes), use `bun changeset add --empty`.

5. **Submit PR**: Push your branch and open a PR to the `main` branch of the main repository. Ensure all tests pass and the package builds correctly.

## Project Structure

### Function Folder

The functions of a category should be placed in a folder.

```
src
  checkouts/      - the functions for `checkouts`
  customers/      - the functions for `customers`
  internal/       - the some `internal` methods
  .../            - the other functions folders
```

A function folder typically contains these 2 files:

```
index.ts      - function source code itself
types.ts      - type definition
```

### Unit Test Folder

Test cases for a category of functions should be placed in a folder. There is a one-to-one correspondence with the functions folder.

```
test
  checkouts/      - Unit tests for `checkouts` functions
  customers/      - Unit tests for `customers` functions
  internal/       - Unit tests for `internal` functions
  .../            - Unit Tests for other functions
```
